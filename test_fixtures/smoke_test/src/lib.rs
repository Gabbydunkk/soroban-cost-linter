//! Fixture contract for the smoke test exercised by
//! `.github/workflows/container-publish.yml`.
//!
//! The container workflow mounts this directory standalone, runs
//! `cargo cost-lint --format json` inside it, and asserts that the
//! `soroban_storage_in_loop` finding appears in the JSON output. The empty
//! `[workspace]` table in `Cargo.toml` keeps cargo from treating the fixture as
//! part of the root workspace, which would make the container smoke test fail
//! with a workspace-membership error before the linter ever runs.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! Every entry point exposes the same anti-pattern — a storage write performed
//! inside a loop — so the container test only needs one lint name to appear,
//! regardless of which entry point the compiler happens to reach first:
//!
//! * [`bad_storage_in_loop`] — the original minimal case from the container
//!   workflow. Kept verbatim so the workflow's assertion stays meaningful.
//! * [`bad_storage_in_loop_nested`] — the same write guarded by an `if`, to
//!   show the pattern survives control flow inside the loop body.
//! * [`bad_storage_in_loop_multiple_keys`] — two distinct writes per iteration,
//!   which also fires `loop_invariant_storage_access` on the invariant write.
//!
//! Refactoring guidance: keep this module no_std, keep each helper free of
//! unused parameters, and keep at least one `instance().set()` inside a loop.
